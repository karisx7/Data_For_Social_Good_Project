# Unit 2 - Data for Social Good Project

## Introduction

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program:
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors.
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about.
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset).
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## User Story 

As a movie enthusiast, I want to find the most popular and well-liked movies so that I can recommend others a wide variety of movies that they can watch based on a movie rating survey and their popularity. I want to inform viewers of what popular movies can be recommended to both novices and movie enthusiasts, how many votes they got in the movie rating survey, and what year they were released.

## Dataset 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/sasakitetsuya/movie-rating-analysis
- **Title** (String) - Title of the movie 
- **Popularity** (double) - Popularity of the movie
- **Year of Release** (int) - Year each movie was released
- **Vote Count** (int) - How many votes each movie got from a survey

## Description 

Write a description of your project here. In your description, include as many vocab words from our class to explain your User Story, the chosen dataset and how your project addressed that users goals. If your project used the Scanner class for user input, explain how the user will interact with your project.

For our Unit #2 project, we decided to create an app that displays movie information
